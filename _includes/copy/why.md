We're Alex and Hannah MacArthur, a couple of Minnesota-to-Tennesee transplants with two of the sweetest little girls, Autumn (3) & Pippa (2).

For as long as we've been married, we've had a desire to adopt. At first, we had absolutely no idea what that might mean in terms of location, finances, age of children, or anything else. But even so, as years went by, that desire seemed to slowly grow into a calling.

Things got more real about two years ago. At the time, we were relatively new to the area, we were working really hard to get rid of our student loan debt, and we had just welcomed our daughter Pippa into the world. Things were less than tranquil, but for some reason, we felt like we should start thinking and praying about making adoption the next big step for our family.

We did, and in 2018, we began to seriously ask ourselves "Why not _now_?"

So, here we are, slowly but eagerly trudging through all of the details that will lead us to bring our next child home.
