We'd be honored for you to be a part of our quilt fundraiser! Your donation of any amount will sponsor a leaf which will have your (or your family's) name on it. All the leaves will be used to make a tree on the quilt, and it will be given to our child as a gift when they come home. We chose this design to be a reminder of family and friends that have cared for them even before they came home.

## How to Sponsor a Leaf

### 1. Pick an amount to give.
Each and every gift is useful, and we are so thankful for your generosity!

### 2. Donate to our matching grant.
Our church (The Bridge in Spring Hill, TN) has generously awarded us a $5,000 matching grant through Lifesong for Orphans, and we're counting every one of these donations toward this quilt fundraiser.

### 3. Imagine how your name will appear on the quilt once it's complete!
Here are just a couple of examples of how the quilt _might_ turn out. Once we find out if we are matched with a boy or girl we'll be able to complete the design. When the quilt is finished, we'll be sure to post pictures for you to see. :)
