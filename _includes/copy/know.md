At this point, here's what we know:

* We are **home-study-approved** to adopt from **South Korea**.
* Our child will be younger than our youngest daughter Pippa (2).
* Our child is most likely alive, and waiting for us right now!
* As soon as we have the necessary funds to proceed, weâ€™ll be ready to be matched with our child, and to start the process to bring him/her home.
