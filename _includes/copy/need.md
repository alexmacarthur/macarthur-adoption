### 1. Pray.
Because of the children already waiting for families in South Korea, our child is most likely alive right now! Pray for the child, whomever God has for us, and for everything involved in their care both before and after they come home.

Pray for us. Pray for God’s hand throughout the process, and for the strength, funds, and persistence we’ll need along the way. Pray for our children during the transition time, and for strength and love to share Mommy and Daddy with a new sibling.

### 2. Give to our quilt fundraiser.
It’s no secret that international adoptions cost more than the average, uh, birth. For various reasons, God often calls people to things they can’t do on their own, and we’re no exception. We are so thankful to have gotten this far in the process, but right now we still need around $23,000 before we can be matched.

To help raise some of these funds, we’re excited to be making a unique quilt for this child, and we’re inviting you to be a part of it!
