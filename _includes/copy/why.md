For as long as Hannah & I have been married (in fact, probably even before that), we've felt a holy pressure within us to _eventually_ adopt. We had vague ideas of what that actually meant in terms of location, finances, age of children, and everything else, but the desire was undeniable, and as we began to grow our family (we currently have two little girls -- Autumn & Pippa), this desire grew into a determination stronger than ever.

Six years and two kids later, the question arose: "Why not _now_?" And after quickly working through every excuse in the book, we were exhausted of every possible reason to say "no." If we feel called to adopt, **let's do it _now_.**

So, here we are, thrilled to bring a new little one into our home, and slowly stumbling through the details, the planning, the questions, and every other challenge to make that happen.
