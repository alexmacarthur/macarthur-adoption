To help raise adoption funds, we're excited to be offering coffee through the one &amp; only <a href="http://muletowncoffee.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Muletown Roasted Coffee</a> out of Columbia, TN.

Once you place your order, it'll take a week or two before it's ready to go. Once it is, we'll let you know to coordinate delivery.

We're not currently shipping coffee, but if you'd like to order from a far, get in touch and we'll send you a separate shipping invoice.

<strong>Thank you for your support!</strong>
