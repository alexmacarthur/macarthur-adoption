In 2015, we moved from Minnesota to Tennessee, knowing no one in the area, and having just found out we were pregnant with our 2nd daughter Pippa. This was hard, but with the support of friends, family, and local community, it was easier.

This time around, things are undoubtedly going to be harder, and we'd be fools to say we don't need the support to bring us into this new stage of our life. That's why we need you, and here's where you can start.

### 1. Pray for us.
Pray for sanity throughout the process, God's hand in providing the strength, funds, and persistence we'll need along the way. Pray for the child with whom we'll eventually be matched, and for those caring for him/her until we can finally bring him/her home.

### 2. Contribute financially.
It's no secret that international adoptions cost more than your average, uh, birth, and we've committed to funding this adoption **entirely debt-free**.

So, if you feel called & comfortable with donating to help cover the cost of this adoption, we'd be forever grateful. Total cost will likely come to around $40,000, and **we're needing to raise around $25,000 to hit that total amount.** We have a couple of exciting plans to help raise that money, but if you'd like to donate now, you can do so by [PayPal](https://www.paypal.me/alexmacarthur), or just by [getting in touch](https://macarthur.me/contact).

### 3. Send us words of encouragement.
It's my (Alex) love language, so please be extra generous.
