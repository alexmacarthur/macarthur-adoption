To help raise adoption funds, we're excited to be offering coffee from <a href="https://muletowncoffee.com/pages/about-us" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Muletown Roasted Coffee</a> out of Columbia, TN.

Due to the fresh roasting and ordering process, it will take a few weeks before the coffee is ready to go. Once it is, we’ll let you know to coordinate delivery/pickup. If you’d like to order from afar, don’t hesitate to get in touch and we can discuss some shipping options.

<strong>Thank you for your support!</strong>
