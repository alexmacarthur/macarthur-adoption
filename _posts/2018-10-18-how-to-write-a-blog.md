The past few weeks (eh, months) have been some stressful, but productive ones! Hannah & I have been p-u-s-h-i-n-g to get some side work done, babies sat, and grant applications completed in order to fund this adoption as quickly as possible. This all sort of feels like a mix between desparately trying to pay for college and race through [Baby Step #2](https://www.daveramsey.com/baby-steps#baby_step_2) as quickly as possible, in parallel. But this time, there's a much more meaningful, tangible reward at the finish line: a baby.

We've seen some big wins in the last couple of weeks, mainly financial. Most notably, we've heard back from THREE of the grants to which we've applied, and all THREE (3/3 = 100%) have awarded us a total of what _should_ work out to be $19,000 (assuming our [matching grant](https://mystory.lifesongfororphans.org/stories/macarthurs-adopting-south-korea/) goes well)!

On top of that, people have just been generous. Generous to the point of "I feel sorta weird because I don't know how to effectively communicate how thankful we are for your help." We are so grateful for the donations and prayers we've received so far, and we certainly don't take even a bit of them for granted.

Big takeaway here: **We need less than $10k to be fully funded.** This is huge. We started at _roughly_ $40k, and now, through saving, working our teesh (plural for "tush") off, and amazing generosity, we're done to $10k. To put it in perspective, we've raised enough money to buy nearly 3,800 24 packs of La Croix from the local Costco.
